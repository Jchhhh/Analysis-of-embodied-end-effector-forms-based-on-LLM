# Analysis-of-embodied-end-effector-forms-based-on-LLM
This study proposes an end-to-end system combining LLMs and generative AI to convert natural language into 3D-printable robotic end-effector models. Through semantic parsing, image generation, and 3D reconstruction, it improves design efficiency, accuracy, and printability, enabling intelligent automated design.
